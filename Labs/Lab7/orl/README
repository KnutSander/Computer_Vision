# The ORL face database

This directory contains a set of faces taken between April 1992 and April 1994
at the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) in Cambridge, UK.

There are 10 different images of 40 distinct subjects. For some of the
subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying lighting slightly,
facial expressions (open/closed eyes, smiling/non-smiling) and facial details
(glasses/no-glasses).  All the images are taken against a dark homogeneous
background and the subjects are in up-right, frontal position (with tolerance
for some side movement).  The size of each image is 92x112, 8-bit grey levels.

When using these images, please give credit to Olivetti Research Laboratory.
A convenient reference is the face recognition work which uses some of these
images:
